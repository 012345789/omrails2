			Why is the Personal 
			â€‹Statement so important?
			The college application process has changed. <strong>Almost all schools place more importance on the personal statement than on SAT scores.</strong>  Grades are still the most important component in a college application.
			 
			UCs roughly weigh an application in the following fashion:
			<ul>
				<li>60% = Grades</li>
				<li>15-20% = Personal Statement</li>
				<li>10-15% = SAT scores</li>
				<li>10% = Recomendations, extra curricular activities, etc.</li>
			</ul>
